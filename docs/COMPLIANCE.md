# Compliance and Safety Framework

## Overview

The AI Voice Assistant for dental marketing operates in a highly regulated environment that requires strict adherence to telecommunications laws, healthcare privacy regulations, and patient safety protocols. This document outlines our comprehensive compliance framework.

## 1. Do Not Call (DNC) Compliance

### Federal DNC Registry Compliance
- **Pre-Call Verification**: All phone numbers are checked against the National DNC Registry before any outbound call is initiated
- **Real-Time Updates**: DNC list is updated daily from federal registry sources
- **Record Keeping**: All DNC checks are logged with timestamps for audit purposes

### Implementation Details
```python
# Example DNC check before call initiation
async def check_dnc_before_call(phone_number: str) -> bool:
    dnc_service = DNCService()
    is_dnc = await dnc_service.check_dnc_status(phone_number)

    if is_dnc:
        logger.warning(f"Call blocked - {phone_number} on DNC list")
        return False

    return True
```

### DNC Opt-Out Process
- **Immediate Removal**: Any request to be added to DNC list is processed immediately
- **Keyword Detection**: AI monitors for phrases like "remove me", "stop calling", "don't call"
- **Manual Override**: Human representatives can add numbers to DNC list instantly

### Business Relationship Exception
- **31-Day Window**: New leads have 31 days of contact eligibility from inquiry date
- **Automatic Expiry**: Exception expires automatically after 31 days
- **Documentation**: All business relationships are documented with inquiry timestamps

## 2. Protected Health Information (PHI) Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Framework
Our system is designed as a **Business Associate** under HIPAA, implementing appropriate safeguards for PHI handling.

### Data Minimization Principles
- **Essential Data Only**: Collect only information necessary for appointment scheduling
- **No Detailed Medical History**: Avoid collecting comprehensive medical records
- **Pain Scale Limitation**: Use simple 1-10 pain scale without detailed symptom description

### Allowed Data Collection
```json
{
  "chief_complaint": "General description (e.g., 'tooth pain', 'checkup')",
  "pain_level": "Numeric scale 1-10",
  "insurance_provider": "Company name only",
  "preferred_appointment_time": "Scheduling preference",
  "urgency_indicators": "Emergency red flags only"
}
```

### Prohibited Data Collection
- Detailed medical history
- Specific medications (except for allergy emergencies)
- Family medical history
- Previous treatment details
- Social security numbers
- Financial information beyond insurance

### Data Security Measures

#### Encryption Standards
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored PHI
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Database**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data

#### Access Controls
- **Role-Based Access**: Limited access based on job function
- **Audit Logging**: All PHI access logged with user, timestamp, and purpose
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

#### Data Retention
- **Call Recordings**: Deleted after 30 days unless escalated
- **Qualification Data**: Retained for 1 year for quality improvement
- **Audit Logs**: Maintained for 6 years per HIPAA requirements

### Example Implementation
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class PHIHandler:
    def __init__(self, encryption_key: str):
        self.cipher = Fernet(encryption_key)

    def encrypt_phi(self, data: str) -> str:
        """Encrypt PHI before storage"""
        return self.cipher.encrypt(data.encode()).decode()

    def decrypt_phi(self, encrypted_data: str) -> str:
        """Decrypt PHI for authorized access"""
        return self.cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data.encode()).decode()
```

## 3. Emergency Escalation Protocols

### Red Flag Conditions
The AI is programmed to immediately escalate calls when detecting:

#### Critical Emergency Indicators
- **Pain Level 9-10**: Severe, unbearable pain
- **Swelling + Fever**: Signs of serious infection
- **Breathing Difficulties**: Airway obstruction concerns
- **Severe Bleeding**: Uncontrolled oral bleeding
- **Trauma/Injury**: Dental trauma from accidents
- **Allergic Reactions**: Signs of medication allergies

### Escalation Decision Tree
```
Patient Response Analysis
├── Emergency Keywords Detected?
│   ├── Yes → Immediate Human Transfer
│   └── No → Continue Assessment
├── Pain Level 9-10?
│   ├── Yes → Emergency Protocol
│   └── No → Standard Qualification
└── Multiple Red Flags?
    ├── Yes → Escalate to Clinical Staff
    └── No → Continue AI Conversation
```

### Escalation Implementation
```python
class EmergencyDetector:
    EMERGENCY_KEYWORDS = [
        "can't breathe", "difficulty breathing", "swelling throat",
        "severe bleeding", "won't stop bleeding", "facial swelling",
        "high fever", "infection", "abscess", "trauma", "accident",
        "knocked out tooth", "allergic reaction"
    ]

    def requires_emergency_escalation(self, user_input: str,
                                    qualification_data: QualificationData) -> bool:
        # Check pain level
        if qualification_data.pain_level == PainLevel.EMERGENCY:
            return True

        # Check for emergency keywords
        input_lower = user_input.lower()
        for keyword in self.EMERGENCY_KEYWORDS:
            if keyword in input_lower:
                return True

        return False
```

### Escalation Response Time
- **Emergency Conditions**: Transfer within 30 seconds
- **High Priority**: Human callback within 2 hours
- **Standard Escalation**: Next business day follow-up

## 4. Call Recording and Consent

### Consent Management
- **Explicit Consent**: "This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes"
- **Opt-Out Option**: Patients can decline recording and still receive service
- **State Compliance**: Two-party consent states receive additional notifications

### Recording Policies
- **Quality Assurance**: Recordings used for AI training and quality improvement
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Random sampling for compliance verification
- **Retention Limits**: Recordings deleted after 30 days unless escalated

## 5. AI Limitations and Disclaimers

Every call begins with: *"Hello, this is Nova, an AI assistant from Premier Dental..."*

### Medical Advice Limitations
```python
MEDICAL_DISCLAIMER = """
I'm an AI assistant designed to help schedule appointments and gather
basic information. I cannot provide medical advice, diagnosis, or
treatment recommendations. For clinical questions, I'll connect you
with our dental professionals.
"""
```

class ComplianceAudit:
    def audit_conversation(self, conversation_history: List[ConversationTurn]) -> Dict:
        violations = []

        # Check for unauthorized medical advice
        medical_advice_patterns = [
            "you should take", "i recommend", "diagnosis", "treatment plan"
        ]

        for turn in conversation_history:
            if turn.speaker == "assistant":
                for pattern in medical_advice_patterns:
                    if pattern in turn.message.lower():
                        violations.append(f"Potential medical advice: {turn.message}")

        return {
            "compliant": len(violations) == 0,
            "violations": violations,
            "audit_timestamp": datetime.utcnow()
        }
```
