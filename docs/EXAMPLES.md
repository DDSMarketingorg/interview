**AI**: Hello David, this is Nova, an AI assistant from Premier Dental calling about your recent inquiry for dental services. I'm here to help schedule your appointment and answer some initial questions. Do you have a few minutes to talk?

**Patient**: Yes, I can talk.

**AI**: Great! What brings you to Premier Dental today?

**Patient**: I need to get a tooth looked at. I think I might need a filling.

**AI**: I understand. Are you experiencing any pain with that tooth?

**Patient**: It's not terrible, maybe a 3 out of 10, but it's sensitive to cold drinks.

**AI**: Cold sensitivity is definitely something our dentists can evaluate. Do you currently have dental insurance?

**Patient**: I'm not really sure. I have health insurance through my job, but I don't know if it includes dental.

**AI**: That's a common question! Many health insurance plans have separate dental coverage. Do you happen to know your insurance company's name?

**Patient**: It's Aetna, I think.

**AI**: Perfect. What works best for your schedule for an appointment?

**Patient**: Probably afternoons after 3 PM on weekdays.

**AI**: Thank you for that information. Since there's some uncertainty about your dental coverage, I'll make sure our insurance verification team checks your Aetna benefits before your appointment. This way you'll know exactly what's covered. Our scheduling team will call you today to confirm your appointment and handle the insurance verification.

**Patient**: That would be really helpful, thank you.

**AI**: You're very welcome! We want to make sure you have all the information you need. You'll hear from our team soon about your late afternoon appointment and insurance benefits. Thanks for choosing Premier Dental!
